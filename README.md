This is a Technical Challenge Task for Switch2Zero

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tech Stack

I used Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn/ui, React Hook Form, Recharts, TanStack Table.

## Reflextion

I must admit this was a challenging task and i rather enjoyed it, having to put multiple complex component together in a short ammount of time was testing but i learned a lot from it.

There are a few bugs that i could not fix in time and a few features i would like to add as well as some refactoring. But im happy with the result and it was good fun.
